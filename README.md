# eFuneral Interview Challenge

This is my solution to the eFuneral challenge.

## Configuration

Before running locally, some things need to be configured. This is done via a JSON file stored at the root of the project called `config.json`. Take a look at `config.example.json` for the schema to be used. The JSON file contains things like API keys, so the one I'm using has been ignored in `.gitignore`.

## Running

To run the program, simply run `go run main.go`. That's it!
