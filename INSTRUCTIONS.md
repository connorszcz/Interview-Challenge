# eFuneral Interview Challenge
Greetings!  We wanted to first thank you for sharing your experiences with us as part of this interview.  The following is a brief work challenge that will allow us to work side by side with you and understand our fit together.  Our goal isnâ€™t to trick you.  If there is anything that is unclear, please ask.

## Challenge
We are looking to develop a tool that can send text messages to multiple contacts in our address book.  We want to be able to schedule a service to run at the beginning of the month to text messages all of our friends at the beginning of their birthday month wishing them a happy birthday.

## The Text Message

When the message is sent it should say:

> Happy Birthday {{RecipientsFirstName}} from {{YourFirstName}} {{YourLastName}}! Call me at {{YourPhoneNumber}} to plan a lunch sometime.

### Message Parameters
Parameter Name | Value
------------ | -------------
{{RecipientsFirstName}}  | First name from the address book dataset
{{YourFirstName}} | Your first name
{{YourLastName}}  | Your last name
{{YourPhoneNumber}} | Your Actual Mobile Phone number (not the one being used in the challenge) formatted 999-999-9999

## The Address Book
Our addressBook.csv file contains the following data elements:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Home Phone
* Mobile Phone
* Street Address
* City
* State
* Zip
* Date of Birth

## Twilio
For this challenge you will be using Twilio to send the messages.  They have impressive API capabilities!

We went ahead and already setup a test account and number.  Those values should have been provided in the email sent to you.
